# Charles Bray Honours Code

Basically everything produced came from "classes.py", it allows you to create the spectra of both absorption and emission .fits files easily, along
 with gaussian decomposition using GaussPy+ (install it in the same location as classes.py). Hopefully it all makes (at least) some sense. I recommend downloading "classes.py"
 and placing it in the same directory as an absorption and emission .fits file for a line of sight and playing around with it. Also look at "example_absorption_spectrum.py" and
 "example_emission_spectrum.py" for simple examples of how it can be used. Make sure you have GaussPy+ installed as well!
 
Since there are dozens of python files (with hundreds of lines of code!) some being neat and some not so neat, I placed the ones I thought were the neatest, and those that give the best example of how to use "classes.py" to complete tasks in this folder. I unfortunately can't upload the absorption .fits files I have used since they're too large, but their names are given in the "gass.py" file and a few others as well (I think you have the .fits files in your directory on the RSAA network), but let me know if I need to hand them to you through some other medium!

I created a "Figures" folder that has subfolders, each named after a chapter in my thesis. In each of these subfolders are the figures I produced for that respective chapter along with the code. The code is messy! I haven't commented these python files, so let me know if you'd like me to comment any of them in particular and I would be happy to do so! 

Let me know if you need any clarification :)
