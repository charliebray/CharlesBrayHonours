Basically everything produced came from "classes.py", it allows you to create the spectra of both absorption and emission .fits files easily, along
 with gaussian decomposition using GaussPy+ (install it in the same location as classes.py). Hopefully it all makes (at least) some sense. I recommend downloading "classes.py"
 and placing it in the same directory as an absorption and emission .fits file for a line of sight and playing around with it. Also look at "example_absorption_spectrum.py" and
 "example_emission_spectrum.py" for simple examples of how it can be used. Make sure you have GaussPy+ installed as well!
 
I decided not to upload every .py file for my thesis since there's several dozen of them, some neat and some not so neat... so I tried to include the ones I thought were the neatest, and those that give the best example of how to use "classes.py" to complete tasks. I unfortunately can't include the absorption .fits files I have used since they're too large, but their names are given in the "gass.py" file and a few others as well (I think you have the .fits files in your directory on the RSAA network), but let me know if I need to hand them to you through some other medium!
